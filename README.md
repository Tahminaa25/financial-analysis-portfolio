## 🔍 Key Findings

Throughout the project, I found the following key insights:  

- Distribution of companies by category and income trends over the years were identified.  
- A strong correlation between ROE and Net Profit Margin was discovered, showing the relationship between performance metrics.  
- The effect of inflation on Net Income was observed, explaining how economic conditions impact companies.  
- K-Means clustering segmented companies into 3 groups based on performance, grouping similar financial profiles together.  

These findings are documented in detail in the notebook with accompanying charts and code snippets.
